To see it in action, you need to start the Expo development server. You can do this by running the following
  commands in your terminal:


  `bash                                                                                                                   
  cd C:\Users\redst\Desktop\gitHub\personal\HabitForge\frontend\HabitForgeApp                                             
  npm start                                                                                                               
  `                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                          
  This will start the Metro Bundler and provide you with a QR code. Scan this code with the Expo Go app on                
  your Android or iOS device to run the app. You can also run it in a web browser or a local simulator.                   
                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                          
  The login and sign-up buttons will now use Firebase to authenticate users.


  What would you like to work on next? We can proceed with:
  1.  Adding Google OAuth to the login screen.
  2.  Setting up a dashboard screen to redirect to after login.
  3.  Beginning the User Profile Creation feature.
